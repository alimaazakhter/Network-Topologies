# Network-Topologies

ðŸ“¡ Network Topologies
This repository explores various network topologiesâ€”the physical or logical arrangement of nodes and connections in a computer network. 
Understanding these structures is fundamental to designing, analyzing, and optimizing networks.

ðŸ”— Included Topologies:

1. Bus Topology â€“ All devices are connected to a single central cable. Simple but limited in scalability.

2. Star Topology â€“ All nodes are connected to a central hub or switch. Easy to manage and troubleshoot.

3. Ring Topology â€“ Each device is connected to two others, forming a circular data path. Offers predictable performance.

4. Mesh Topology â€“ Devices are interconnected with many redundant connections. High reliability and fault tolerance.

5. Tree Topology â€“ A hybrid that combines characteristics of star and bus topologies, suitable for large networks.

6. Hybrid Topology â€“ Mix of two or more topologies to meet specific requirements.

Each topology is explained with diagrams, use cases, advantages, and limitations.
